**Last updated: February 8, 2026**

## Introduction

Nisafone is a transcription app that does everything locally on the phone.
This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data Stored Locally

Nisafone stores all data locally on your device. This includes:

- **Transcripts**: The transcript of words heard by Nisafone.

**This data never leaves your device** unless you choose to send it using another app installed on your phone.

### Data We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect personal information
- We do not collect usage analytics
- We do not collect location data
- We do not use tracking technologies
- We do not create user accounts
- We do not store data on external servers

## Data Storage

All app data is stored locally on your device in the app's private storage area. This data is:

- Only accessible by the Nisafone app
- Deleted when you uninstall the app
- Not backed up to cloud services by the app itself (though your device's backup settings may include app data)

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect or transmit any data from your device.

When you use the "Share" feature to share a transcript, you control where that transcript is sent using your device's standard sharing options.

## Permissions

Nisafone may request the following permissions:

- **Microphone access**: To transcribe conversations, it needs access to the microphone.

These permissions are used solely for the stated purposes and do not result in any data being collected or transmitted.

## Children's Privacy
